// Your entire stylesheet should be nested in the "html .themed" selector. This 
// prevents your theme from accidentally overriding any styles in the Pop editor. 
// Also, some javascript libraries (e.g. fancybox) append dom elements directly 
// to the body. Add the ".themed" class to those elements and you can style them 
// here as well. It's not a great solution, but at least it works!

html .themed {
  &#pop {
    // Add any styles you need on "#pop" here
  }
  // Add your selectors and styles here
}
